Well done for using an interface that the ArrayDirectory implements and overrides the methods

You have used an entry class to store your information, but you've kept the class variables as global public. These should be private.

Your insert method works well, however, if there is an Entry (Barnes, J, 80501) and you try to add a new Entry of (Barnes, J, 80502) it should ignore this Entry

Your print method works as expected.

Your delete by number and delete by name both work as expected, well done

Both your amend number and lookup methods work as expected.

You have shown evidence of reading information from a file, well done.

No evidence of performance testing found.

Whilst your ArrayDirectory is generally really good. You shouldn't have put the GUI code inside this class. Ideally, this should be in its own file for the separation of content.

Good implementation of the ListDirectory and HashDirectory solutions. However, your HashDirectory doesn't handle the error of trying to delete an entry that doesn't exist.

Sufficient commenting throughout. No use of packages found and some error handling throughout - however, more is needed.

Good implementation of a GUI but bad program layout and implementation. Separate complexity into separate files. This includes your testing values.

Documentation
Generally, the documentation is good. However, more evidence of correctness testing is needed and a further comparison between the performance of the different parts is needed.
